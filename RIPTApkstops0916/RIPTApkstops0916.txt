  Description:
    Abstract: Rhode Island Public Transit Authority,  RIPTA, statewide park and ride lots designated as bus stops for public transit service with individual route  and stop information effective September 2016.
    Purpose: Transportation and transit system planning.
    Supplemental_Information: It is not the intention when using this data set to  determine the exact routing, timing or scheduling of bus trips. Transit system routes and  schedules  including frequency of service change periodically.  Users of this data should check with RIPTA for the most up to data information and not rely on this data for final determinations. Please visit the RIPTA website for official bus stop and bus route information http://www.ripta.com.

      Source_Contribution: Used as spatial base for roads by which bus stops were located.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Road segments over which bus routes are located were selected from the RIGIS RIDOT 2010 roads data set and merged to form the spatial bust route data set using ESRI ArcView software.  Bus stop locations were manually positioned over digital road centerline features and/or located with field GPS techniques. Designated park and ride lots were selected from the overall bus stop data set.
